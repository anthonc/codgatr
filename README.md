## 💡 About CodGatr

**CodGatr** is the essential extension for developers working with AI. It acts as a bridge between your AI conversations and your IDE, allowing you to instantly extract, organize, and download code blocks generated by platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

Forget manually copying and pasting files one by one. CodGatr intelligently detects identifying comments (like `# filename: script.py`) to name your files automatically, bundles everything into a clean ZIP archive, or lets you download individual snippets with a single click.

Now featuring a **Premium "Cyber-Sleek" Interface** with dark glassmorphism, smooth animations, and a focus on developer experience.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Smart Code Detection** - Automatically identifies code blocks in chat streams.
- 📁 **Instant Downloads** - One-click download for any code snippet.
- 📦 **Project ZIP Bundles** - Download session code as a complete project ZIP.
